    <h1>Show labels on Trello</h1>
    <h2>Uninstalled</h2>
    <p>Thanks for using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/show-labels-on-trello/">this extension</a>, but it's no longer needed. Trello added this functionality to their site. All you have to do is click on the label in Trello and it will toggle titles on or off.</p>
    <p>This extension has been uninstalled.</p>
